So I finally gave up the static site script minimalism after breaking my site when I tried to change the script. So let's embrace the so called "bloat" and move in. 

So I won't really go into setting up Hugo because it's stupid easy and [this](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) should really be all you need. Although there is no void linux package for hugo you can convert the debian package using [xdeb](https://github.com/toluschr/xdeb.git) or use a flatpak or snap if you're into that. 

Hugo has a really nice live server so it's easy to edit things once you're set up.

I'm using the [Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme at the moment, but I will probably either edit it or switch to another theme in the future

I've copied over my old horrible irrelevant blog posts and such plus my about page, so there's no real info lost.
