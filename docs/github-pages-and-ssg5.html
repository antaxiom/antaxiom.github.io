<h2 id="What%20is%20ssg?">What is ssg?</h2>

<p>Ssg is self described as &#8220;a static site generator written in shell. Optionally it converts Markdown files to HTML with lowdown(1) or Markdown.pl&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#39;s written by a fellow called <a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/">Roman Zolotarev</a></p>

<p><img src="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg4.png" alt="ssg4-source" />
<em>image of the sgg4 source code as featured on Roman&#39;s site</em>
<br /><br /></p>

<p>It&#39;s very lightweight and easy to use, and as said earlier it&#39;s completely written in shell script</p>

<h2 id="Why%20should%20I%20use%20a%20script%20instead%20of%20a%20full%20static%20site%20generator?">Why should I use a script instead of a full static site generator?</h2>

<p>Most static site generators are unecesarily heavy with a lot of features you won&#39;t need, especially for the purposes of a small site like mine</p>

<h2 id="How%20do%20I%20use%20ssg5?">How do I use ssg5?</h2>

<p>Using ssg is pretty simple but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m fit for the task of explaining the exact use cases so I&#39;ll leave some useful links here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">The author&#39;s official page and guide</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ttw2Dihn8">Wolfgang&#39;s Video on the subject</a></p>

<h2 id="ssg5%20modifications">ssg5 modifications</h2>

<p>Wolfgang has made a <a href="https://notthebe.ee/src/ssg5">modified version</a> which he explains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ttw2Dihn8">in his video</a></p>

<p>Now the problem with this version is that it doesn&#39;t work on Linux (and probably other unix systems) since <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43171648/sed-gives-sed-cant-read-no-such-file-or-directory">cut is a bit different</a> on MacOS</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antaxiom/antaxiom.github.io/master/bin/ssg5">My version</a> has a check so it should work on both MacOS and Linux</p>

<h2 id="Github%20pages%20integration">Github pages integration</h2>

<p>This is where I come in,
since I don&#39;t have my own server I decided to use Github pages as means of hosting my site</p>

<p>First thing to note, Github requires to have your site either in the <code>&#47;</code> or the <code>docs&#47;</code> folder of your repo</p>

<p><img src="images/github-pages-picker.png" alt="github-pages-picker" /></p>

<p>So you have to make sure ssg5 exports to <code>&#47;docs</code> as <code>&#47;</code> is obviously not viable</p>

<p>You can facilitate building with a <a href="https://makefiletutorial.com/">makefile</a>, you can reference <a href="https://github.com/antaxiom/antaxiom.github.io/blob/master/makefile">mine</a> as a example of what <em>not</em> to do</p>

<h1 id="You&amp;#39;re%20done!">You&#39;re done!</h1>

<p>The site you&#39;re looking at right here was made using this exact method (could you tell?) if you want to look into some of the source feel free, it&#39;s available <a href="https://github.com/antaxiom/antaxiom.github.io">here</a></p>

<p>After this you can add some css to the site (<a href="https://github.com/antaxiom/antaxiom.github.io/blob/master/src/style.css">here&#39;s mine</a>) and add something like a <code>.htaccess</code> file so you can get a clean address bar</p>
