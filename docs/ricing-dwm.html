<title>Ricing journey: dwm</title></p>

<h6 id="December%2015,%202020">December 15, 2020</h6>

<h1 id="How%20I%20riced%20dwm">How I riced dwm</h1>

<h2 id="What%20is%20ricing%20&amp;#47;%20Window%20Managers">What is ricing &#47; Window Managers</h2>

<p>Any attempt at me explaining this will probably cause more confusing, so I recommend you read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/index">this</a></p>

<h3 id="Back%20story">Back story</h3>

<p>i3wm was the first wm I ever used</p>

<p>dwm was the second window manager I used after I (accidentally) formatted my Ubuntu partition</p>

<h2 id="Suckless%20software">Suckless software</h2>

<p><a href="https://suckless.org/">Suckless software</a> is pretty interesting, it is based on very minimalist software</p>

<p>For it to be usable for basically anyone you&#39;re going to need to patch the source code for basic functionality and rebuild, that&#39;s the workflow for all suckless software</p>

<p>They plan on keeping a small amount of devoted but smart users</p>

<p>You can read about their philosophy <a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/">here</a>, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s perfect but it can really work sometimes</p>

<h2 id="The%20actual%20rice">The actual rice</h2>

<p>My rice with through many iterations but I&#39;m just going to put what I more or less finished with here</p>

<p>I used these patches:</p>

<pre><code>dwm-activetagindicatorbar-6.2.diff
dwm-actualfullscreen-20191112-cb3f58a.diff
dwm-attachaside-6.1.diff
dwm-autostart-20200610-cb3f58a.diff
dwm-bar-height-6.2.diff
dwm-colorbar-6.2.diff
dwm-fixborders-6.2.diff
dwm-pertag-perseltag-6.2.diff
dwm-rotatestack-20161021-ab9571b.diff
dwm-vanitygaps-mod-6.2.diff
</code></pre>

<p>I definitely have lots of patches in my config and I don&#39;t use all of them anymore but I&#39;ll summarize why I use each</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Active Tag Indicator</strong>

<ul>
<li>Makes the top bar look nicer than the default one</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Actual Full Screen</strong>

<ul>
<li>Has a system for making windows full screen within another layout instead of other solutions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Attach Aside</strong>

<ul>
<li>Makes it so new windows are a spawned as a stack window instead of the master (larger) window</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Autostart</strong>

<ul>
<li>Simple and sweet, runs a script located in <code>~&#47;.dwm&#47;autostart.sh</code> every time dwm starts</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bar Height</strong>

<ul>
<li>Another visual bar modification, lets me pick the high as I with</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Colorbar</strong>

<ul>
<li>Sets more color variables, so they are not shared (lets me make the bar background one solid color)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fixborders</strong>

<ul>
<li>Odd patch I think should be upstream at this point, makes it so the borders render property with a compositor and some weird cases</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pertag Perseltag</strong>

<ul>
<li>Lets me have a different layout, master size and stack size, ect. on each tag</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rotate Stack</strong>

<ul>
<li>Lets me rotate a window through the stack, kind of regretful of using this patch but I can&#39;t be bothered to change it</li>
<li>It didn&#39;t do what I actually wanted which was to swap between two windows, it&#39;s hard to explain but it moved the entire stack with it (which is what the rotating meant)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vanity Gaps (mod)</strong>

<ul>
<li>This is an interesting one, it is a modification for vanity gaps that adds layouts that are written to work with the gaps</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>That was a very long list to write</p>

<h3 id="Other%20tools%20I%20use%20with%20this">Other tools I use with this</h3>

<p>I use a compositor (picom) and a bunch of other things in startup</p>

<p>I use dmenu as a launcher in combination with <a href="https://github.com/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop">j4-dmenu-desktop</a> to open .desktop files with dmenu</p>

<p>I use the default dwm bar and use i3blocks to set its contents</p>

<p>I have</p>

<ul>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>A playerctl script (to see currently playing content)</li>
<li>And a script to show COVID cases where I live

<ul>
<li>(not showing this since it will date this post a lot)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Functionality">Functionality</h3>

<p>Unlike my first wm, dwm is not manual</p>

<p>This means that placement is automatic, you don&#39;t have to specify horizontal or vertical positioning</p>

<p>Instead you pick a layout which then defines where each window goes</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t as fine controlled as manual tiling but in practice it is a lot more practical</p>

<h3 id="Visual%20Appearance">Visual Appearance</h3>

<p>This rice looks like this</p>

<p><img src="images/dwm-rice.png" alt="dwm-rice" />
- I must note that the rice is broken right now since I haven&#39;t used it in a while and my setup has changed a lot</p>

<p>I use my colors that are based on onedark and some custom colors I picked with the help of others</p>

<p>I affectionately call it Toodark since I get many complains about the insane contrast (with the background being <code>#111111</code>)</p>

<p>I use East Asian Characters (they&#39;re not just Japanese!) for the tag numbers because anything else didn&#39;t look as pretty</p>

<p>For the font I use JetBrains Mono (Nerd Font) it&#39;s basically the font I use for all monospaced stuff</p>

<h3 id="Problems">Problems</h3>

<p>dwm has some problems like any window manager</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even talking about the suckless philosophy and patching</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about something I don&#39;t hear discussed nearly enough around windows mangers</p>

<p>It&#39;s about compatibility, it may seem like Iâ€™m nitpicking at points but I&#39;ve had various issues like this before</p>

<ul>
<li>Java applications not cooperating well (this affects quite a few things but it&#39;s as easy as renaming the window manager to LG3D and or <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dwm#Fixing_misbehaving_Java_applications">this</a>)</li>
<li>Windows not going where&#39;d you expect, this is kind of specific but sometimes windows wanted to float when they shouldn&#39;t but dwm has ok rules by default on this, future wms I discuss may not</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>For as painful as it looks to set up the config outside of patching is very painless and it&#39;s a dead simple introduction to dynamic window managing</p>
